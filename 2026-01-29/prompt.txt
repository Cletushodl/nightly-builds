Build a single-file fitness quick-logger web app (index.html) with these features:

1. **Run Logger**: Fields for date, distance (miles), duration (mm:ss), avg HR, max HR, notes. Auto-calculates pace.
2. **Strength Logger**: Date, exercises (name, sets x reps x weight), duration, notes.
3. **Body Comp Logger**: Date, weight (lbs), body fat %, muscle mass, BMI (all optional except date+weight).
4. **Log Viewer**: Shows all logged entries in reverse chronological order, grouped by type.
5. **Export**: Button to export all data as markdown matching this format:

```
### Run - Jan 28
- Distance: 3.11 mi
- Duration: 28:45
- Pace: 9:15/mi
- Avg HR: 148 | Max HR: 167
- Notes: Easy pace
```

Design requirements:
- Dark theme, mobile-first (Charles logs from his phone)
- Clean, minimal UI with tabs for each logger type
- Data stored in localStorage (persists between sessions)
- No external dependencies — pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Color scheme: dark gray background (#1a1a2e), accent blue (#0f3460), highlight cyan (#16c79a)
- Smooth animations on tab switches
- Big touch-friendly buttons and inputs

Make it look GOOD. This is for a guy who was a professional mechanic — clean, functional, no BS.
